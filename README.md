# Python Animation Graph Project

This project is a two file project, and both files need to be running.<br/>

### data_gen.py

First you need to start the data_gen.py file. This file will create a CSV file if one doesn't exist, and start entering
random numbers into the CSV file. You need this file running first. Both sensors start at 1000.<br/>

### main.py

Then start the main.py file it will read the CSV file, and plot a chart for each sensor until you stop the programs. When you restart the program files the CSV file gets rewritten, so it always starts at 1000 for both sensors.
